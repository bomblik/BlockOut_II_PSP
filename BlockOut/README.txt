How to retrieve your high score and config when moving from release 2.4 to 2.5?
===============================================================================

Uninstal Blockout.
Install 2.5 or newer release.
Launch the game (It should create the Blockout directory in C:\Users\(user name)\AppData\Local)
Go to the old blockout instalation directory (which can be the same than the 2.5 release).
Select "replay","hscore.dat","replay.idx","setup.dat".
Move them to C:\Users\(user name)\AppData\Local\Blockout.
Note that the Users and AppData directories may be hidden.

How to compile the source ?
===========================

  - BlockOut II source can be donwloaded from sourceforge http:/sourceforge.net/projects/blockout

Windows:

  - You need Microsoft VS2013
  - Install SDL 1.2.15 development libraries (from http://www.libsdl.org)
  - Install SDL Mixer 1.2.12 development libraries (from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release-1.2.html)
  - Set all appropriate include and lib paths in the project properties
    (for ImageLib,SDL and SDL_Mixer)
  - Set the working directory to the BlockOut project root

Linux:

  - Execute make within the ImageLib source directory
  - Edit the Makefile in the blockout directory and set the appropriate PATH to the ImageLib (if needed)
  - Execute make or (make _linux64=1 on 64bits OS) in the BlockOut directory
  
About Replay (.bl2replay) file
==============================

  For each high score you make, a .bl2replay file is created within
  the directory InstallPath/replay (or $(HOME)/.bl2/replay for linux).
  These files contain replay data which are needed if you want to upload
  your score to the on-line score database. A replay can be uploaded 
  only once as soon as it has been successfully registered. If you 
  abort a game by pressing [Esc], the replay file won't be saved.
  A file name starting with 'l' means local replay, with a 'r' means
  remote replay.

About Score Uploading
=====================

  To upload your high score to the online database, just go to the
  Score Details page and select Upload. You can enter a different
  name and a comment. Note that only score made with a release
  >=2.2 can be uploaded (Replay file needed).

About the Randomizer:
=====================

 The Blockout II random generator generates a sequence of all possible 
 pieces (depending on the pit dimension and block set) permuted randomly,
 as if they were drawn from a bag. Then it deals all pieces of the 
 sequence before generating another bag. It is not possible to get
 3 times the same piece. The random permuation is generated by a classic
 linear congruential generator.

About the Frame limiter and Vertical synch mode:
================================================

 To synchronize animations with the vertical blanking of the monitor 
 you have to select VSync in the frame limiter setting, to save your
 setup and to restart the application.
